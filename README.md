🚀 New Mini Project Completed – WordCloud Generator using Wikipedia! 🌐✨

I just built a WordCloud Visualization project in Python that fetches data directly from Wikipedia and generates a visually appealing WordCloud 🎨 where the size of each word reflects its frequency in the article.

🔧 Tech Used:
✅ Python
✅ wikipedia API
✅ wordcloud library
✅ Matplotlib for visualization

📌 Key Highlights:
🔹 User can input any topic and instantly see a WordCloud.
🔹 Supports error handling for ambiguous or missing pages.
🔹 Beautiful color maps and stopword removal for cleaner results.

This is a simple yet powerful way to visualize important keywords in large text data — great for quick topic summaries and presentations!

💡 Next step: I plan to extend this to generate WordClouds from multiple sources and compare them side by side.

Would love to hear your thoughts!
